The aim of this task is to demonstrate your ability to reflect on the course content, with specific reference to the ways in which working therapeutically with children and adolescents may differ from working therapeutically with adults.
It is intended that this reflective exercise will consolidate your learning by providing an opportunity to make meaningful connections between the course content and other knowledge you have attained throughout your program and/or experiences you may have had in other contexts.
What you will do
For this task, you will prepare four (4) individual reflections on topics/issues covered in this course.  Each of these reflections should be between 250 and 300 words in length.
You may choose any topics that you wish. The only specification is that we must have covered the topics in some w代 写COUN7012/PSYC7806 Assessment Three: Personal ReflectionsPython

You may like to use real-world examples to illustrate your learning. If you choose to do this, please ensure the examples are de-identified to protect the privacy of those involved in the example.
As this task is intended to be reflective, there is no expectation that you will include empirical sources in this task. However, if you do make use of any sources, please ensure you cite them in accordance with APA formatting.
Submission:
Please submit your reflections via the Turnitin submission link in Blackboard. This task can be submitted at any time between week 5 and week 13 of semester. The final submission date is Friday of week 13 at 1pm.
Use of AI or MT technologies
This task is intended to be prepared without the use of AI. The purpose of this task is to facilitate your personal reflection in your capacity as an emerging professional who may be working with children and adolescents in the future. As such, it is important that you engage in this process authentically. Any use of AI should be minimal and, if used, must be acknowledged.
Please note: 
· Turnitin checks for the use of AI and provides an estimated percentage of AI generated content in your paper. The use of AI without proper acknowledgement represents a breach of academic integrity.
· The use of editing software such as Grammarly can inflate the AI score in your Turnitin report. Please ensure you retain a copy of your original paper, in case there is a need to investigate your use of AI.
